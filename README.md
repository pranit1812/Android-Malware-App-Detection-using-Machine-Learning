## Features

- **Malware Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models to differentiate between benign and malicious Android applications.
- **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes APK files to extract critical features such as permissions, activities, receivers, services, and intents for classification.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates the performance of 16 different machine learning models to identify the most effective for malware detection.


### Data Preparation
- **Data Collection**: Collected 1000 APK files, comprising both benign and malware samples.
- **Feature Extraction**: Used Python scripts and APKtool for reverse engineering APKs and extracting manifest files to parse essential features.

### Machine Learning
- **Models Used**: Included Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, SGD Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVC, and more.
- **Classification**: Evaluated models based on their F1 scores and other performance metrics to determine their effectiveness in classifying apps as malicious or benign.

## Results

- **Optimal Feature**: Permissions used by the apps provided the highest overall F1 scores, making it the most significant feature set for malware detection.
- **Best Model**: SGD Classifier emerged as the most optimal classifier across various feature sets.
- **Additional Dataset**: Employed the Android Malware Dataset (CIC-AndMal2017) for further validation, achieving a best F1 score of 0.86 with the SGD Classifier.
